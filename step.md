## npm init (ask yourself, what does this do);
## set up your folder structure (what folders do I need for an 
express app)


## Set up you server and get it running (this takes about four lines of code)
## go to localhost and see cannot get you have your server running
// require express
// app.listen(9000)

## set up your views, (this have to set the view engine, and the path to the views)
## If I get an errors have to do with I can't find a view, can't get a view,
## then something may be wrong with these lines


##  set up your controller
## what do I have to do to set up a controller (I export, to where?)

## Inside your controller set up a route
## render a handlebars view and check to make it works

## Set up your public folder, and put links on your view page, and make sure
## they load, (I'll need something in my server file, and script/link tags in 
my handlebars folder)
